# ADR-0003: Testing Strategy Refinement

Date: 2025-05-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

With the core application architecture established, a comprehensive testing strategy is needed to ensure reliability, maintainability, and confidence in future changes.

## Decision

| Concern             | Choice                                | Rationale                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit Testing        | **Jest + React Testing Library**      | Standard in React ecosystem, focuses on user behavior |
| Component Testing   | **Storybook + Chromatic**             | Visual testing and component isolation                |
| Integration Testing | **Playwright**                        | Cross-browser E2E tests with easy debugging           |
| API Testing         | **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**         | Network-level mocking instead of function mocks       |
| Coverage Targets    | **80% for core hooks and components** | Balance between confidence and maintenance effort     |

## Consequences

• The multi-layered approach ensures both unit functionality and user flows are verified.

• Playwright tests provide confidence in critical user journeys without excessive test maintenance.

• MSW allows testing hooks and components with realistic API interactions without hitting production endpoints.

• Storybook integration facilitates component-driven development and serves as living documentation.

## Follow-ups

1. Set up visual regression testing with Chromatic or Percy.
2. Create GitHub Action matrix to run tests across multiple Node versions and browsers.
3. Consider adding contract testing if backend APIs evolve independently.
