# ADR-0005: Deployment Architecture

Date: 2025-06-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Countries Dashboard requires a deployment strategy that balances developer experience, performance, cost, and operational simplicity.

## Decision

| Concern             | Choice                                  | Rationale                                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Hosting     | **Vercel**                              | Native Next.js support, preview deployments, analytics         |
| Containerization    | **Multi-stage Docker**                  | Environment portability, consistent builds across environments |
| Environment Config  | **Environment Variables + .env.local**  | Simple secret management with good DX                          |
| CDN Strategy        | **Vercel Edge Network + Static Assets** | Global distribution with minimal configuration                 |
| Fallback Deployment | **Netlify Static Export**               | Alternative deployment option if Vercel isn't available        |

## Consequences

• Vercel provides the best developer experience for Next.js apps with automatic preview deployments on PRs.

• Multi-stage Docker builds ensure the app can be deployed to any container platform if needed.

• Environment variable strategy allows for easy local development while securing production secrets.

• The dual deployment options (Vercel + containerized) provide flexibility for different hosting scenarios.

## Follow-ups

1. Set up monitoring and alerting for production deployment.
2. Document deployment procedure for both Vercel and container-based options.
3. Consider infrastructure-as-code options (Terraform, Pulumi) if more complex environments are needed.
