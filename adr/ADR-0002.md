# ADR-0002: Authentication Implementation

Date: 2025-05-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Countries Dashboard requires a basic authentication system to demonstrate full-stack capabilities and provide a foundation for potential user-specific features in the future.

## Decision

| Concern          | Choice                         | Rationale                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auth Framework   | **NextAuth.js**                | Integration with Next.js, built-in session management, multiple provider support |
| Auth Providers   | **GitHub OAuth & Credentials** | GitHub for social login convenience, credentials for email/password              |
| Session Strategy | **JWT**                        | Simpler implementation without database requirement                              |
| Protected Routes | **Middleware-based**           | Centralized auth checks with Next.js middleware for route protection             |

## Consequences

• NextAuth.js adds minimal bundle size while providing a complete authentication solution that works well with the Next.js App Router.

• Supporting both OAuth and credentials gives users flexibility while demonstrating different authentication flows.

• JWT-based sessions simplify deployment but may require rotation strategies for production use.

• Middleware-based protection creates a single source of truth for access control logic.

## Follow-ups

1. Consider adding more OAuth providers based on user feedback.
2. Implement role-based access control if admin features are needed.
3. Add rate limiting and additional security measures if the application scales.
