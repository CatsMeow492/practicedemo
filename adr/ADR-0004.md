# ADR-0004: Performance Optimization

Date: 2025-05-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Countries Dashboard requires optimizations to ensure fast initial load times, good SEO, and responsive user experience across devices and network conditions.

## Decision

| Concern             | Choice                                | Rationale                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Image Optimization  | **Next.js Image Component**           | Automatic resizing, WebP/AVIF conversion, lazy loading            |
| Data Fetching       | **Static Generation + ISR**           | Pre-render popular countries with Incremental Static Regeneration |
| Bundle Optimization | **Code-splitting + Tree-shaking**     | Reduce initial load size with dynamic imports                     |
| Analytics           | **Web Vitals Tracking**               | Monitor Core Web Vitals for real-world performance                |
| Prefetching         | **Link Prefetching for Common Paths** | Anticipate user navigation patterns                               |

## Consequences

• Static generation with ISR provides fast initial loads while keeping data reasonably fresh.

• Next.js Image component abstracts away complex image optimization while reducing Cumulative Layout Shift.

• Dynamic imports add complexity but significantly improve initial page load metrics.

• Web Vitals tracking allows data-driven performance improvements over time.

## Follow-ups

1. Implement responsive image srcsets for different device sizes.
2. Consider implementing streaming SSR for long country lists.
3. Evaluate selective hydration strategies as they mature in Next.js.
