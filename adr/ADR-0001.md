# ADR-0001: Technology & Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-05-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are building an interactive Countries Dashboard that must be:

1. **Fast & SEO-friendly** – The list page should ship as HTML for crawler friendliness yet stay snappy when navigating client-side.
2. **DX-oriented** – Contributors need quick feedback (lint, type-check, tests) and isolation of UI pieces.
3. **Polished UI / accessible** – Dark-mode, keyboard nav, and semantic tokens out of the gate.
4. **Well-tested & deployable anywhere**.

## Decision

| Concern             | Choice                                 | Rationale                                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rendering strategy  | **Next.js 13 App Router**              | Built-in hybrid SSR/SSG, image optimisation, SEO `<Head>` helpers.      |
| Language            | **TypeScript**                         | Static analysis + improved DX (autocomplete, refactor-safe).            |
| Styling / theming   | **Tailwind CSS** tokens                | Quick to theme, tree-shakes dead styles, first-class dark-mode support. |
| Data fetching       | **React Query (TanStack Query)**       | Declarative cache, stale-while-revalidate, hooks-centric.               |
| Component isolation | **Storybook**                          | Visual TDD, docs for designers, Chromatic diffing later.                |
| Testing             | **Jest** (unit) + **Playwright** (E2E) | Familiar, fast, headless; covers both unit and integration.             |
| CI                  | **GitHub Actions**                     | Free minutes, easy matrix builds, status checks on PRs.                 |
| Hosting             | **Vercel**                             | Zero-config for Next.js, preview URLs on PRs, image loader.             |
| Containerisation    | **Docker (multi-stage)**               | Enables parity between local, CI, prod if we self-host.                 |

## Consequences

• We inherit Next 13's file-system routing and server actions; contributors must stay current on latest patterns.

• Tailwind enforces utility-first approach; component libraries (e.g., Mantine) can still layer on top if desired.

• React Query adds another dependency, but simplifies stale data handling dramatically versus raw `fetch()` calls.

• Storybook + tokens require initial setup effort but pay off when building multiple states (loading, error, dark mode, etc.).

## Follow-ups

1. Set up Tailwind config with semantic tokens (bg-surface, text-primary, etc.).
2. Add Storybook CI publish step to Chromatic or Netlify.
3. Re-evaluate React Query vs. native `fetch` + `use` once React suspense fetcher stabilises.
