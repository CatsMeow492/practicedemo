Below is a concise but "production‑minded" road‑map I'd follow if I had 2–3 focused days to ship a polished Countries Dashboard for TXR.
The list is strictly 20 steps, ordered to surface documentation, testing, and DX items early so they don't become after‑thoughts later.

## Progress Tracker

| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1-7  | ✅ Done | Initial setup complete |
| 8-20 | 🚧 Todo | API integration and features pending |

⸻

1. Bootstrap the repo & CI ✅
	•	npx create-next-app@latest countries-dashboard --ts --eslint --tailwind (or Mantine/MUI if you prefer).
	•	Turn on GitHub Actions for lint + type‑check on every push.
	•	Add CODEOWNERS to enforce PR reviews.
	
	> **DONE**: Project initialized with Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind. GitHub Actions workflow added for CI.

2. Write a living README.md ✅
	•	Problem statement, tech stack choices (Next 13 App Router for SSR + SEO, React Query for data‑fetching, Playwright for E2E, etc.).
	•	"How to run / test / deploy" section so another engineer can start in <5 min.
	
	> **DONE**: Created README with tech stack overview, feature highlights, and developer instructions.

3. Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR‑0001) ✅
	•	Summarise why Next.js, Tailwind/Mantine, React Query, Vercel, etc.
	•	Shows the reviewer the intentionality behind each choice.
	
	> **DONE**: ADR-0001 documents all technology choices with rationale and consequences.

4. Set up Prettier + Husky ✅
	•	Pre‑commit hook to run lint --fix and unit tests. Prevents noise in the PR diff.
	
	> **DONE**: Added Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks with lint-staged integration.

5. Establish Storybook ✅
	•	npx storybook@latest init for isolated component work and built‑in visual docs.
	•	Deploy Storybook to Chromatic or Vercel preview automatically.
	
	> **DONE**: Storybook configuration added with main and preview files. Deployment pending.

6. Define a CSS/Theme token file ✅
	•	Tailwind config (or Mantine theme override) with semantic tokens (bg-surface, text-primary, etc.) to make dark‑mode a one‑liner.
	
	> **DONE**: Tailwind config with semantic tokens (surface, text, primary) and dark mode support.

7. Scaffold basic routes & layout ✅
	•	/ → Countries grid
	•	/country/[code] → Detail page
	•	Layout component housing <Header> (search, theme toggle) and <main>.
	
	> **DONE**: Root layout and basic home page scaffolded. Country detail page pending.

8. Integrate REST Countries API wrapper
	•	src/lib/restCountries.ts with typed Axios instance + Zod schema validation to guard against malformed data.

9. Implement React Query hooks
	•	useCountries, useCountry(code) with caching, error boundaries, and loading states.

10. Draft unit tests for hooks
	•	Jest + Testing‑Library‐React‑Hooks to assert successful fetch, error retries, caching behaviour.

11. Build the CountryCard component
	•	Accepts Country DTO, shows flag, name, population, region, capital.
	•	Add Storybook stories (light & dark) + snapshot test.

12. Assemble the Countries grid page
	•	Responsive CSS grid (auto‑fill minmax) with skeleton loaders, search box, region filter dropdown (Mantine <Select>).

13. Write integration tests for the homepage
	•	Playwright: search for "bel", expect "Belgium" card visible; filter by "Asia", Germany disappears.

14. Create the Country detail template
	•	Two‑column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile; back button; badge list for border countries (links back to detail pages).

15. Accessibility & SEO pass
	•	Use <Image> + alt.
	•	Provide lang tags for native names; <Head> meta titles (Belgium – TXR Countries Explorer).

16. Add basic auth stub (full‑stack brownie points)
	•	Install NextAuth with a simple GitHub provider; wrap pages in SessionProvider.
	•	Demonstrates awareness of auth plumbing even if not required.

17. Lighthouse & performance tweaks
	•	Pre‑render top 8 popular countries with getStaticProps; lazy‑load the rest.
	•	Optimise flag images via Next Image remote loader.

18. Containerise (optional but quick)
	•	Multi‑stage Dockerfile so app can run anywhere, not just Vercel.

19. Deploy
	•	Vercel for SSR OR Netlify for static export; add environment variable placeholders (NEXT_PUBLIC_COUNTRIES_API).

20. Final documentation & hand‑off
	•	Update README with architecture diagram (PlantUML or Excalidraw).
	•	List known trade‑offs / future work (state management swap, pagination for >250 countries, i18n).
	•	Tag a release (v0.1.0) so maintainers have a clean starting point.

Quick Notes on "Why"
	•	Tests early: catching schema mismatches up‑front signals craftsmanship and reduces last‑minute bugs.
	•	Docs first: The ADR + README show deliberate decision‑making—exactly what the consultant is hunting for.
	•	Storybook & tokens: help another dev iterate on UI without spelunking through the app.
	•	Auth stub: not in the brief, but signals you're comfortable full‑stack.
	•	Container + CI: tiny effort, huge long‑term payoff for reproducibility.

Feel free to adapt library choices (Mantine vs. Tailwind, Cypress vs. Playwright). The key is that every step explains both the what and the why, leaving no cognitive load for the reviewer. Good luck—you've got this!
