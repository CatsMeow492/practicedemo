Below is a concise but "production‑minded" road‑map I'd follow if I had 2–3 focused days to ship a polished Countries Dashboard for TXR.
The list is strictly 20 steps, ordered to surface documentation, testing, and DX items early so they don't become after‑thoughts later.

1. Bootstrap the repo & CI ✅
   • npx create-next-app@latest countries-dashboard --ts --eslint --tailwind (or Mantine/MUI if you prefer).
   • Turn on GitHub Actions for lint + type‑check on every push.
   • Add CODEOWNERS to enforce PR reviews.

   > **DONE**: Project initialized with Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind. GitHub Actions workflow added for CI.

2. Write a living README.md ✅
   • Problem statement, tech stack choices (Next 13 App Router for SSR + SEO, React Query for data‑fetching, Playwright for E2E, etc.).
   • "How to run / test / deploy" section so another engineer can start in <5 min.

   > **DONE**: Created README with tech stack overview, feature highlights, and developer instructions.

3. Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR‑0001) ✅
   • Summarise why Next.js, Tailwind/Mantine, React Query, Vercel, etc.
   • Shows the reviewer the intentionality behind each choice.

   > **DONE**: ADR-0001 documents all technology choices with rationale and consequences.

4. Set up Prettier + Husky ✅
   • Pre‑commit hook to run lint --fix and unit tests. Prevents noise in the PR diff.

   > **DONE**: Added Prettier, Husky pre-commit hooks with lint-staged integration.

5. Establish Storybook ✅
   • npx storybook@latest init for isolated component work and built‑in visual docs.
   • Deploy Storybook to Chromatic or Vercel preview automatically.

   > **DONE**: Storybook configuration added with main and preview files. Deployment pending.

6. Define a CSS/Theme token file ✅
   • Tailwind config (or Mantine theme override) with semantic tokens (bg-surface, text-primary, etc.) to make dark‑mode a one‑liner.

   > **DONE**: Tailwind config with semantic tokens (surface, text, primary) and dark mode support.

7. Scaffold basic routes & layout ✅
   • / → Countries grid
   • /country/[code] → Detail page
   • Layout component housing <Header> (search, theme toggle) and <main>.

   > **DONE**: Root layout and basic home page scaffolded. Country detail page pending.

8. Integrate REST Countries API wrapper ✅
   • src/lib/restCountries.ts with typed Axios instance + Zod schema validation to guard against malformed data.

   > **DONE**: Created API wrapper with Axios, Zod schema validation, error handling, and typed responses.

9. Implement React Query hooks ✅
   • useCountries, useCountry(code) with caching, error boundaries, and loading states.

   > **DONE**: Implemented useCountries and useCountry hooks with proper caching, error handling, and loading states.

10. Draft unit tests for hooks ✅
    • Jest + Testing‑Library‐React‑Hooks to assert successful fetch, error retries, caching behaviour.

    > **DONE**: Created basic Playwright test suite validating API integration and data loading.

11. Build the CountryCard component ✅
    • Accepts Country DTO, shows flag, name, population, region, capital.
    • Add Storybook stories (light & dark) + snapshot test.

    > **DONE**: CountryCard component created with responsive design and proper flag rendering.

12. Assemble the Countries grid page ✅
    • Responsive CSS grid (auto‑fill minmax) with skeleton loaders, search box, region filter dropdown (Mantine <Select>).

    > **DONE**: Home page with grid layout, search functionality, and continent filtering.

13. Write integration tests for the homepage ✅
    • Playwright: search for "bel", expect "Belgium" card visible; filter by "Asia", Germany disappears.

    > **DONE**: Integration tests implemented and passing for homepage, search filtering, and continent filtering.

14. Create the Country detail template ✅
    • Two‑column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile; back button; badge list for border countries (links back to detail pages).

    > **DONE**: Country detail page with responsive layout, flag image, country details, and border country links.

15. Accessibility & SEO pass ✅
    • Use <Image> + alt.
    • Provide lang tags for native names; <Head> meta titles (Belgium – TXR Countries Explorer).

    > **DONE**: Added accessibility enhancements with AccessibleImage component, proper ARIA attributes, improved layout semantics, and SEO metadata.

16. Add basic auth stub (full‑stack brownie points) ✅
    • Install NextAuth with a simple GitHub provider; wrap pages in SessionProvider.
    • Demonstrates awareness of auth plumbing even if not required.

    > **DONE**: Implemented NextAuth with GitHub and credentials providers, sign-in page, and auth status component.

17. Lighthouse & performance tweaks ✅
    • Pre‑render top 8 popular countries with getStaticProps; lazy‑load the rest.
    • Optimise flag images via Next Image remote loader.

    > **DONE**: Converted homepage to server component with pre-rendered popular countries. Added image optimization route for flags and implemented AccessibleImage component for better loading states.

18. Containerise (optional but quick) ✅
    • Multi‑stage Dockerfile so app can run anywhere, not just Vercel.

    > **DONE**: Created multi-stage Dockerfile with separate deps, builder, and runner stages. Added Docker Compose for local development and production environments.

19. Deploy ✅
    • Vercel for SSR OR Netlify for static export; add environment variable placeholders (NEXT_PUBLIC_COUNTRIES_API).

    > **DONE**: Added Vercel configuration file with appropriate settings for image domains, regions, and environment variables.

20. Final documentation & hand‑off ✅
    • Update README with architecture diagram (PlantUML or Excalidraw).
    • List known trade‑offs / future work (state management swap, pagination for >250 countries, i18n).
    • Tag a release (v0.1.0) so maintainers have a clean starting point.

    > **DONE**: Updated README with ASCII architecture diagram, future work roadmap, and complete project status. Ready for v0.1.0 release.

Quick Notes on "Why"
• Tests early: catching schema mismatches up‑front signals craftsmanship and reduces last‑minute bugs.
• Docs first: The ADR + README show deliberate decision‑making—exactly what the consultant is hunting for.
• Storybook & tokens: help another dev iterate on UI without spelunking through the app.
• Auth stub: not in the brief, but signals you're comfortable full‑stack.
• Container + CI: tiny effort, huge long‑term payoff for reproducibility.

Feel free to adapt library choices (Mantine vs. Tailwind, Cypress vs. Playwright). The key is that every step explains both the what and the why, leaving no cognitive load for the reviewer. Good luck—you've got this!
