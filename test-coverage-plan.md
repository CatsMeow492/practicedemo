# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Completed Improvements

### API Route Testing
- ✅ Fixed NextRequest/NextResponse mocking issues in API route tests
- ✅ Implemented proper mocking for `flags` route
- ✅ Implemented proper mocking for `ask-country-ai` route
- ✅ Resolved Next.js RSC metadata export errors by excluding problematic files

### Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Updated Jest configuration to exclude metadata exports from coverage
- ✅ Added proper mocking for Lucide React icons
- ✅ Improved test isolation and cleanup

## Current Coverage Status
As of the latest test run, we have:
- Test Suites: 14 passed, 14 total
- Tests: 61 passed, 61 total
- Overall Coverage: ~26.37% (statements)

## Next Steps for Improving Test Coverage

### Priority 1: Core Component Tests
- [ ] Add tests for `CountriesGrid.tsx` component (0% current)
- [ ] Add tests for `ThemeToggle.tsx` component (0% current)
- [ ] Add tests for `WikipediaInfo.tsx` component (0% current)
- [ ] Add tests for `CountryQA.tsx` component (0% current)

### Priority 2: Auth and Feature Tests
- [ ] Add tests for `AuthStatus.tsx` component (0% current)
- [ ] Add tests for NextAuth implementation in `[...nextauth].ts` (0% current)
- [ ] Test PostHog feature flagging and experiments

### Priority 3: Extend Existing Test Coverage
- [ ] Increase branch coverage for `restCountries.ts` service (currently 37.93%)
- [ ] Improve function coverage for hook tests (currently 0% for custom hooks)
- [ ] Add page component integration tests

### Priority 4: E2E Testing
- [ ] Implement Playwright E2E tests to cover critical user flows
- [ ] Test responsive behavior across device sizes

## Implementation Strategies

### Component Mocking
Use the established approach for mocking dependencies:
```typescript
jest.mock('next/dependency', () => ({
  Component: jest.fn(() => <div data-testid="mocked-component" />)
}));
```

### API Route Testing
Continue using the pattern established for API route tests:
```typescript
jest.mock('path/to/route', () => ({
  HANDLER: jest.fn().mockImplementation((request) => {
    // Mock implementation
  })
}));
```

### Testing React Query Hooks
For testing hooks that use React Query:
- Use `QueryClientProvider` in tests
- Mock the API response
- Test loading, error, and success states

## Coverage Targets
- Short-term goal: 40% overall coverage
- Medium-term goal: 60% overall coverage
- Long-term goal: 80% overall coverage with critical paths at 90%+
